Primary Note: We have package managers today! I evaluated Hunter, Conan and vcpkg for availability of each of these libraries.

From Twitter: https://twitter.com/lefticus/status/1564017510290075650

Defacto Standard:

    ASIO https://think-async.com/Asio/ - which is what the networking TS is based on. Can be used with or without boost conan, hunter, vcpkg

Larger utility libraries:

    Qt https://www.qt.io/ - has all the things. Just use it if you already use Qt vcpkg, conan
    wxWidgets - https://wxwidgets.org - Crossplatform GUI library with Networking vcpkg
    Poco - https://pocoproject.org/ more than just networking hunter, vcpkg, poco
